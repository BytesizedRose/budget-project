Budget Project

This is a super simple budgeting project I made based on the way that I personally do my budget, which I call "dollars per day." I budget this way when we're financially tight and want to avoid running out of cash before payday, or dipping into savings.

## HOW TO USE:
Step 1 - Add up your total cash on hand
Step 2 - Check off which bills have been paid
(edit the names to represent your actual information, add more if needed)
Step 3 - Count how many days until your pdayday
Step 4 - Voila! You now know how much money you can safely spend per day.

## THINGS I LEARNED:
1. I learned how to place and style elements on the page using HTML and CSS
2. I learned about parseFloat, .toFixed(), and how to use them
3. I learned how to pull data from the user's input, as well as display data on the page

## NEXT STEPS:
I'd really like to include a feature where I can tell it when I get paid, so that I won't have to count the days manually. It would also be cool to include calendar and calculator modules that actually work.

Enjoy :)
